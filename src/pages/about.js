      <p>
        I thought today we would do a happy little picture. Go out on a limb -
        that's where the fruit is. Now let's put some happy little clouds in
        here. You're meant to have fun in life. Just use the old one inch brush.
        There's nothing wrong with having a tree as a friend.
      </p>

        I guess I'm a little weird. I like to talk to trees and animals. That's
        okay though; I have more fun than most people. The very fact that you're
        aware of suffering is enough reason to be overjoyed that you're alive
        and can experience it. It just happens - whether or not you worried
        about it or tried to plan it. Let's get wild today. Everybody needs a
        friend. Everything's not great in life, but we can still find beauty in
        it.
