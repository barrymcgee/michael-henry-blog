I just wanted to let everyone know that I started a weekly newsletter called _The iOS Coding Newsletter_. It will be released every Tuesday, and there are already three issues published. This newsletter will be focusing on interesting iOS resources, tutorials, books, apps, productivity, and much more. I would appreciate your support, and of course, I would love it if you could tell a friend! You can view the newsletters that have already been published and signup for future newsletters [here][1].
